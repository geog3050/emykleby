# GEOG 5055 Repository - Eric Mykleby
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Iowa studying remote sensing, GIS, agricultural science, and other related disciplines. I am married and have 2 children, Hayden (3) and Ella (1). I enjoy watching sports and doing many things outdoors.

# Repository
My Github repository holds all of the work that I have done in the Spring 2021 semester for Dr. Caglar Koylu's Geospatial Programming course. The assignments folder holds all of the code for the assignments we completed. There are essentially two versions of every assignment in this folder: one original version, and one corrected version where changes were made based on instructor feedback. These are labeled with a corr suffix.
The quizzes folder holds all of the quizzes that were taken for this course. There are not as many of these and there are also no official separate corrected versions. However, some corrections were made.
There is also a final project folder that holds the code for my final project. There is also an image in this folder that shows the workflow from this project from ArcGISPro.
